# How to Start Your Own Code Club — Community Guide

Welcome to the SORTEE open guide to starting and running a Code Club. This guide was written by and for the SORTEE and broader coding community during the SORTEE Conference 2025.

## What is this guide about?

This guide collects real experiences, tested strategies, and participant-contributed tips from the [SORTEE](https://sortee.org/) 2025 Unconference session "*How to Start Your Own Code Club*."

This guide provides:

- **Practical advice** on launching and running a Code Club  
- **Real tips from facilitators and participants** across universities or research institutes, and online communities  
- **Session formats ideas** (seminars, workshops, hacky hours) and how to choose what fits your group  
- **Solutions to common challenges** like balancing skill levels, finding session ideas, or sustaining motivation  
- **Resources and links** to existing materials and community examples  

It's a living document! Any contributions or improvements are always welcome (see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)) .
