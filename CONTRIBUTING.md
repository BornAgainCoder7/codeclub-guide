## How to Get Started

### 1. Explore the Repository

- Read the [README.md](README.md) to understand the project's mission and scope.
- Browse the [index.qmd](index.qmd) file to see the current guide content.
- Look at existing `issues` to see what others are working on or what is needed.

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

To render and preview the guide locally, you'll need:

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (free, open source)
- A text editor (VS Code, RStudio, Obsidian, or any markdown editor)
- Git and a GitHub account

**Local Setup:**
- Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/SORTEE/start-your-codeclub-guide.git
cd start-your-codeclub-guide
```
- Render the site:
`quarto render`

- Preview locally:
`quarto preview`
The preview will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3200/` (or similar). Edit the `.qmd` or `.scss` files, and changes will auto-refresh.

### 3. Check Existing Issues

Before starting work, look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/YOUR-REPO/issues) to see if your idea is already being discussed. If not, consider opening an issue to discuss significant changes before investing time in a PR.

**Good reasons to open an issue first:**
- Proposing a large new section or reorganization
- Suggesting changes to the guide's structure or tone
- Reporting a bug or accessibility issue
- Asking for feedback on an idea
