    "text": "2 What Is a Code Club?\nAt its heart, a Code Club is a peer-learning community where people come together to improve their coding skills, share reproducible practices, and learn without judgment. It is both a safe space for exploration and a structured way to maintain regular coding practice in good company.\n\n2.1 Shared Learning and Skill Development\nFocus on learning from one another and improving overall coding abilities through collaboration.\n\n‚ÄúPeer-to-peer learning of (open) coding skills‚Äù\n‚ÄúA place to learn new things‚Äù\n‚ÄúCommunity of practice to learn + share skills‚Äù\n\nCore idea: a Code Club is a learning community where everyone teaches and learns.\n\n\n2.2 Improving Code Quality and Reproducibility\nEmphasis on writing better, more transparent, and more reliable code.\n\n‚ÄúPrevent unintentional errors‚Äù\n‚ÄúLearning and discussing code to minimise errors and develop best practices‚Äù\n‚ÄúA safe place to discuss coding and how to make it more reproducible‚Äù\n\nCore idea: Code clubs exist to strengthen reproducibility and good practices collectively.\n\n\n2.3 Dedicated, Supportive Time and Space\nHighlighting the intentional act of setting aside space for coding together.\n\n‚ÄúAllocated time to discuss coding, resolving issues and improving coding‚Äù\n‚ÄúA place where you can discuss coding techniques and skills without judgment‚Äù\n\nCore idea: a Code Club gives people a protected, inclusive time for shared coding and problem-solving.\n\n\n2.4 Collaboration and Enjoyment\nAcknowledging the social and motivational side ‚Äî learning through doing, creativity, and fun.\n\n‚ÄúPlace to work on separate code problems in the community or work on fun challenges together‚Äù\n\nCore idea: coding becomes more motivating and enjoyable when done collectively and informally.\nA key observation from these inputs is that no one defined a Code Club by its format, but they defined it by its purpose. In practice, Code Clubs can be online, in-person, or hybrid; large or small; formal or informal. The unifying idea is that a Code Club provides dedicated time and an inclusive atmosphere for continued coding practice and shared learning.\n\nImportant to remember\nAll the cool kids join code clubs üòé"

    "text": "3 Format and Frequency\nThere is no single correct way to run a Code Club. What matters most is consistency and an approach that fits the people involved. During the unconference, participants described several ways they organise, or would like to organise, their clubs:\n\nWeekly or biweekly meetings for ongoing support and continuity.\nMonthly sessions that balance preparation time with participation energy.\nOccasional workshops or annual events that bring broader groups together.\n\nAcross all of these forms, three practices stood out as particularly effective:\n\nKeep groups small and steady (around 5‚Äì15 people). A consistent core helps build familiarity and community over time.\nChoose an accessible format. Online or hybrid meetings work well for people who cannot always attend in person.\nShare the organising role. Rotating leadership keeps the workload manageable and encourages distributed ownership.\n\nThese patterns illustrate that how often or where the club meets is less important than creating a predictable rhythm and a space people enjoy returning to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant Tip\n\n\n\nIn-person participants are usually more engaged, because less temptation to do something else in the background"

    "section": "4 Session Types",
    "text": "4 Session Types\nThis section describes different formats a Code Club can structure its meetings. During the unconference, facilitators proposed three core formats (seminar-style talks, hands-on workshops, and hacky hours), while participants added additional creative options such as book and journal clubs or short show-and-tell sessions.\nEach format supports a different kind of learning. Choosing a mix of them helps keep the community dynamic, inclusive, and engaging.\n\n4.1 Seminar‚ÄëStyle Talks\nStructured around short talks or demonstrations, these sessions are a good fit for sharing conceptual knowledge and introducing big-picture ideas.\nGood for:\n\nExplaining the theoretical background or principles of reproducible research.\nDelivering visual or figure-based explanations.\nReaching a broad audience.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nRequires the most preparation and planning.\nBeginners may find them harder to follow if the content is advanced.\nDiscussion needs to be actively encouraged to keep engagement high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant Tip\n\n\n\nSeminar-style sessions are great for more maths/stats type talks that don‚Äôt really work for workshops\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Hands‚ÄëOn Workshops\nInteractive sessions where everyone codes along. These take more preparation but allow deep learning through doing.\nGood for:\n\nBuilding practical skills and learning new tools together.\nEncouraging active participation from all attendees.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nSessions often take longer than expected.\nDifferent coding languages or skill levels can complicate pacing.\nFlexibility is key ‚Äî it‚Äôs fine if not everyone finishes the materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilitator Tip\n\n\n\n‚ÄúYou need to be super flexible: some things take a lot longer than you think, you might have weird dependency issues, etc. It‚Äôs important to be ready to adapt if needed, and be okay with not necessarily getting to the end of the materials.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Hacky Hours\nInformal, collaborative sessions focusing on solving problems or exploring ideas together. They require minimal preparation and emphasise community support.\nGood for:\n\nDiscussing code challenges or research-specific issues.\nPeer troubleshooting and spontaneous advice-sharing.\nStrengthening connections across skill levels.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nFacilitation still matters; a clear start helps participants feel comfortable.\nSome people may feel self-conscious about sharing unfinished code.\nBeginners benefit from small demos or examples to focus the discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilitator Tip\n\n\n\n‚ÄúBeginners often don‚Äôt know what questions to ask. One suggestion is to start by showing something (small demo) you‚Äôre working on to give a starting point.‚Äù\n\n\n\nImportant to remember\n‚ÄúHacky Hours are great for creating engagement, and showing that at every level of coding experience mistakes are common ‚ù§Ô∏è√ó100.‚Äù\n\n\n\n4.4 Other Formats Ideas\nParticipants also suggested additional lightweight options that make meetings more varied and inclusive.\n\nBook Clubs ‚Äî follow a single book over an extended period, reading chapter by chapter. They work well as a recurring theme for the year and provide a strong structure for regular meetings. Examples mentioned included Statistical‚ÄØRethinking, R‚ÄØfor‚ÄØData‚ÄØScience, and Hands‚ÄëOn‚ÄØProgramming‚ÄØwith‚ÄØR.\nJournal Clubs ‚Äî focus on papers, preprints, or tutorials chosen for a session. These require less planning and can respond to current community interests or new methods.\nShow‚Äëand‚ÄëTell Sessions ‚Äî short rounds (5-10 minutes) where each participant presents a favourite package, workflow, or function. Quick to organise and highly interactive, they build confidence and spark conversation across experience levels."

    "text": "5 Common Challenges and Solutions\nEvery Code Club will face its own mix of organisational and interpersonal challenges. During the unconference, participants contributed several recurring themes and shared practical ways to address them. The following section compiles those common issues and the strategies that have helped others keep their Code Clubs sustainable, accessible, and enjoyable.\n\n5.1 Finding Ideas for Sessions\nChallenges:\n\nRunning out of topics.\nNot knowing participants‚Äô skill levels or current interests.\nBalancing multiple coding languages (R‚ÄØvs‚ÄØPython).\n\nSolutions:\n\nCollect topic suggestions during the first session or through anonymous feedback forms.\nAsk participants to vote on themes or rank potential ideas.\nPlan sessions around topics you personally want to learn.\nMix language‚Äëneutral themes such as version control, project organisation, or using Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilitator Tip\n\n\n\n‚ÄúThink of people, not just topics ‚Äî invite those in your network who love teaching or can share practical experience.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Balancing Skill Levels\nChallenges:\n\nBeginners can feel lost, while advanced users may become disengaged.\nParticipants may hesitate to ask questions or feel intimidated by others‚Äô expertise.\n\nSolutions:\n\nAlternate introductory and advanced sessions so everyone periodically feels comfortable.\nUse breakout rooms or small groups that mix experience levels.\nEncourage experienced attendees to mentor newer ones, teaching reinforces their own understanding.\nHave a session on how to vibe code / use AI Chatbots to code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilitator Tip\n\n\n\n‚ÄúEven experienced coders weren‚Äôt taught all the basics, reviewing them benefits everyone!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThink that even if you are proficient with a tool or a language, there‚Äôs always new, or more efficient, or slightly different ways of solving a problem!‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Managing Workload and Consistency\nChallenges:\n\nSustaining energy and motivation over time.\nFinding time to prepare materials.\nBalancing Code Club duties with other responsibilities.\n\nSolutions:\n\nShare responsibilities with other organisers!\nRotate hosts for variety and capacity-sharing (e.g., alternating between PhD students and postdocs).\nReuse existing materials; foundational workshops (Git, plotting, data manipulation) remain relevant year after year.\nUse publicly available tutorials such as Happy‚ÄØGit‚ÄØwith‚ÄØR or the SORTEE‚ÄØCode‚ÄØClub resources (see list of resources below).\n\n\n\n5.4 Addressing Imposter Syndrome and Low Turnout\nChallenges:\n\nFeeling unqualified to lead.\nThe fear of making mistakes publicly.\nSessions with low attendance or quiet participation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilitator Tip\n\n\n\n‚ÄúFeel the fear, and DO IT ANYWAY!‚Äù\n\n\nSolutions:\n\nNormalise imperfection ‚Äî live coding helps participants see that everyone makes mistakes.\nStart small and consistent; even a small group can grow into a stable community.\nEncourage senior researchers to model openness about their own uncertainties.\nMake people feel valued part of the code club. They don‚Äôt have to present or ask questions, but know that it‚Äôs a safe place where no judgment takes place!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilitator Tip\n\n\n\n‚ÄúSay out loud when you‚Äôre unsure. Everyone relates, and it breaks the ice.‚Äù"

    "text": "6 Getting Started: Steps You Can Try Tomorrow\nGetting a Code Club off the ground can feel overwhelming, but you don‚Äôt have to have everything figured out before your first session. The ideas below came straight from participants and facilitators who have joined or built Code Clubs Communities and know what helps a group grow. These advices focuses on practical and low‚Äëbarrier steps, encouraging you to start with what you have and build momentum as you go.\nYou don‚Äôt need to wait for the right moment. Just start and experiment!\nüí° 1. Be Consistent\n\nChoose a regular meeting time and space and stick to it. Consistency helps the community form, even if only a few people attend at first.\nEmbed sessions into an existing routine, such as right after lab meetings or during lunch breaks.\n\nüí° 2. Make It Easy to Join\n\nSchedule sessions at accessible times.\nOnline or hybrid participation works well for people with limited mobility or packed schedules.\nEmphasise that participants can come when they can ‚Äî low‚Äëpressure involvement helps retention.\n\nüí° 3. Keep It Safe and Welcoming\n\nRemind everyone that not knowing something is fine; learning together is the goal.\nDraft a Code of Conduct early, ideally during the first meeting, so the group defines its own norms.\nBe explicit that mistakes are part of learning: kindness and respect come first.\n\nüí° 4. Keep It Engaging\n\nFocus on community first: belonging leads to sustained participation.\nExperiment with different formats: seminars, hacky hours, or short themed sessions.\nRegularly ask participants to vote or comment on upcoming topics.\nYour participants are also your co-leads! Encourage anyone to show a tool, share a trick, or guide a session. Shared responsibility strengthens engagement and helps the club stay active without depending on a single organiser.\n\nüí° 5. Start Small and Iterate\n\nInvite a few labmates or colleagues to try a first session; it doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect.\nWatch a short tutorial or read a paper together and talk about it.\nBuild from there as participation and confidence grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilitator Tip\n\n\n\n‚ÄúStart small! Ask your lab members, or your grad cohort, if they would be interested in a get‚Äëtogether. You can watch the same tutorials or read the same paper and comment together!‚Äù"
